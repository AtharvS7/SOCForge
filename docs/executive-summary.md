# SOCForge — Executive Summary

## What is SOCForge?

SOCForge is an enterprise-grade Security Operations Center (SOC) platform designed to simulate, detect, and investigate cyber threats. It provides security teams with a comprehensive environment for training, testing detection capabilities, and practicing incident investigation workflows.

## Key Capabilities

### 🔴 Attack Simulation
Simulate realistic cyber attacks — from initial reconnaissance to data exfiltration — generating controlled threat telemetry for detection testing.

### 🟡 Automated Detection
Six built-in detection rules automatically identify threats including brute force attacks, network scanning, reverse shells, and command-and-control beaconing.

### 🟢 Incident Investigation
Correlated alerts are automatically grouped into incidents with chronological timelines, affected host mapping, and MITRE ATT&CK framework alignment.

### 📄 Reporting
Generate professional investigation reports with executive summaries, findings, indicators of compromise, and actionable recommendations. Export as PDF.
